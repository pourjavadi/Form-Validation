This repository provides a robust form validation script that ensures user input meets required patterns and standards before submission. It is designed to improve user experience by providing immediate feedback on input errors in fields such as full name, email address, password, birth date, and gender selection.

## Features

- Real-time validation feedback
- Customizable validation rules for different input types
- Supports various data formats (e.g., email, password, date)
- Easy to integrate with modern web frameworks

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pourjavadi/Form-Validation
```
2. Include the validation script in your HTML file.
3. Add `data-validation` attributes to your form elements.

## Usage

The form validation script automatically binds to form fields with specific `data-validation` attributes and validates the input on-the-fly. Check the `examples` directory for usage patterns and integrate them into your project as needed.
